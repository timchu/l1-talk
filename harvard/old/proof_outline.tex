\begin{frame}{Proof Outline}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item (Known) Any Manhattan distance can be realized as a Manhattan
  distance between a subset of corners of a high dimensional rectangle (hyperbox).
  \item (New) Any Bernstein function, when applied to a Manhattan
  distance, gives a \textbf{squared} Euclidean distance.
  \item This embedding into squared Euclidean distance happens to map
  vertices to corners of a hyperbox. Thus, these distances are secretly
  Manhattan distances.
  \item Therefore, Any Bernstein function, when applied to a Manhattan
  distance, gives a Manhattan distance.
