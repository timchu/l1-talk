  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item  In general, given metric spaces $M_1, M_2$, you can ask what
  functions $f$ send $M_1$ to $M_2$.
  \item When $M_1 = \{$Tree metrics, Electrical Resistance Distances,
  Manhattan distances$\}$ and $M_2 = \{$ Manhattan distances, Squared
  Euclidean Distances $\}$, we've shown that $f$ sends $M_1$ to $M_2$
  if and only if $f$ is Bernstein (unpublished).
  \item More questions: What about functions that send a generic metric
  space to effective resistances?
  \item What happens if you allow embedding with distortion?
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Future Work (via Representation Theory)}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item  A core piece of our proof relied on the symmetry group of the
  box.
  \item Theoretically, our proof strategy might be able to classify all
  functions $f$ that send metrics that arise from objects with group
  symmetries, to Manhattan or squared Euclidean distances.
  \item For example.... what functions send crystal lattices to
  Euclidean distances? What functions send icosohedrons to Euclidean
  distances? What functions send generalized platonic solids to
  Euclidean distances? And more.
  \item This is the question I am most interested in :).
